\section{Results}\label{results}

TODO

\subsection{Improvements}\label{improvements}

Can have multiple dependent jobs/algorithms

reusing VMs - closes after some time

\subsection{Problems}\label{problems}

unecessary data copying - not using same VM for followup jobs

no error handling

no or only few information in interface, if problem related to cloud, not application

only few information in log files

manual resume not always helping

sometimes workflows not startable, need to restart gUSE often - unstable

\subsection{Testing}\label{testing}

starting different tests under different conditions

works with reliable cloud

but not when cloud is busy and may fail

problems with handing data from one job to another with parameter sweep (works with only one job)

\subsection{Missing functionality}\label{missing}

working Remote API

Visualization of running VMs

Information about errors in interface and/or error documentation

more options for controlling the cloud resources

need to restart gUSE when changing stuff

userfriendly interface

option to use the system without the web interface
