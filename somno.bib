	shorttitle = {The Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit},
	abstract = {The Extensible Neuroimaging Archive Toolkit ({XNAT)} is a software platform designed to facilitate common management and productivity tasks for neuroimaging and associated data. In particular, {XNAT} enables qualitycontrol procedures and provides secure access to and storage of data. {XNAT} follows a threetiered architecture that includes a data archive, user interface, and middleware engine. Data can be entered into the archive as {XML} or through data entry forms. Newly added data are stored in a virtual quarantine until an authorized user has validated it. {XNAT} subsequently maintains a history profile to track all changes made to the managed data. User access to the archive is provided by a secure web application. The web application provides a number of quality control and productivity features, including data entry forms, data-type-specific searches, searches that combine across data types, detailed reports, and listings of experimental data, upload/download tools, access to standard laboratory workflows, and administration and security tools. {XNAT} also includes an online image viewer that supports a number of common neuroimaging formats, including {DICOM} and Analyze. The viewer can be extended to support additional formats and to generate custom displays. By managing data with {XNAT}, laboratories are prepared to better maintain the long-term integrity of their data, to explore emergent relations across data types, and to share their data with the broader neuroimaging community.},
